# Blockchain Courses

This is my repository made to put all my blockchain studies and you can find them all by switching to each of the folders I created here.

## Setup

First of all, clone this repository by using the command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tonashiro/blockchain-solidity-course.git
```

Then you can switch to any of the project you want to test.

```
cd "folder name here"
```

After that, on every folder you will see a specific README and you can learn how to run the project.
